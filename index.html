              Hey, I'm Zachary Chapmanâ€”a programmer, gamer, and new parent. By
              day, I code solutions; by night, I conquer virtual worlds.
              Parenthood recently joined the adventure, adding chaos and joy.
              Join me as I share insights, experiences, and the delightful
              intersection of code, games, and parenting. Let's connect and
              explore together!

              <p>
                Starting the OSU bootcamp introduced me to web development
                through a hands-on project, where I mastered HTML, CSS, and
                JavaScript basics. Beyond coding, I learned about website
                structure and the importance of collaboration. This marked the
                beginning of my ongoing passion for web development, fueled by
                the solid foundation gained at OSU.

                This project was given with motivation to refactor a website
                that aides accessibility. The goal was to contribute to a more
                inclusive web environment by ensuring usability for individuals
                with diverse needs. The project addresses the common issue of
                exclusionary web design by adhering to accessibility standards.
                Inthe development process we emphasized the importance of
                writing "DRY" (Don't Repeat Yourself) code, promoting efficiency
                and maintainability.
